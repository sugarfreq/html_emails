                    			<p>Dear Dr. [[LastName]],</p>
                    			<p>I’m reaching out to share some exciting news about your Officite Web Presence. On July 8th, 2015, you will receive access to a new and upgraded doctor portal, which can be found at https://secure.officite.com. The current portal, located at portal.officite.com, will be retired on July 8, 2015. </p>
                    			<p>The new portal is being released as part of our ongoing effort to provide clients with the most current Web Presence solutions available to us. It includes a variety of new features designed to streamline your office processes and make your Web Presence more efficient and easier to use.</p>
                    			<p>Highlights of the new doctor portal include:
                    				<ul>
                    					<li>Enhanced HIPAA compliance</li>
										<li>Improved method of tracking support tickets</li>
										<li>Live support chat</li>
										<li>Upgraded look and feel</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Don’t worry; you will not need to do anything to prepare for the new portal’s release. The upgrade will take place during the evening hours of July 7, 2015, and we anticipate a seamless transition. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact the Client Services team via email at production@officite.com, or by phone  at 1.877.393.3348. </p>
								<p>If you’d like a sneak peek at your new portal, sign into the current version the week of June 29th! </p>
								<p>All the best,</p>
